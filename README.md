# Drug Recommender System
  
__Overview__  
  
  
There are multiple drugs available for a condition, and consumers often have difficulties choosing drugs for their conditions.   
My aim of this project is to make a recommendation system for patients by predicting patients outcome using drug reviews.  
  
The original dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29  
  
The recommender system potentially can help patients to choose better drugs for their conditions, and also can provide benchmark to drug providers such as doctors and pharmaceutical companies.  
  
__How to Run__  
1. Getting dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29
