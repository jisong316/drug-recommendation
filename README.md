# Drug Recommender System
  
__Overview__  
  
  
There are multiple drugs available for a condition, and consumers often have difficulties choosing drugs for their conditions.   
My aim of this project is to make a recommendation system for patients by predicting patients outcome using drug reviews.  
  
The original dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The recommender system potentially can help patients to choose better drugs for their conditions, and also can provide benchmark to drug providers such as doctors and pharmaceutical companies.
